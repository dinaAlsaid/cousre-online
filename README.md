## Web Application

***[Explain your app, should be at least a paragraph. What does it do? Why should I use? Sell your product!]***

The web application consists of a frontend written in Razor views, HTML, CSS,
Bootstrap, Popper, and jQuery. The backend was written in C# using ASP.NET Core 2, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.

An interface is provided to create new blog
posts, view existing blog posts, edit existing blog posts, delete existing
blog posts, and search by both keywords and user names. All blog posts can be
enriched using Azure Language Services (part of Microsoft's Cognitive Services
suite), Bing Image API, and Parallel Dots (for automated tagging of posts via
key phrases detected within the post's body). Image enrichments can be added
based on the overall sentiment score (a range 0.0 - 1.0 related to the mood
of the post) and key phrases / keywords detected in the posts. Optionally, users
can choose to opt-out of these features for privacy or data collection concerns.
